In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store data, a common error is encountering a 'undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.setItem')' error. This typically happens when AsyncStorage is accessed before it's fully initialized.  Another less common, but equally frustrating, issue arises when dealing with nested objects and arrays within AsyncStorage. Attempting to directly stringify and parse complex data structures can result in unexpected behaviors, data corruption, or difficult-to-debug errors. The challenge lies in properly handling data serialization and deserialization for nested data.
